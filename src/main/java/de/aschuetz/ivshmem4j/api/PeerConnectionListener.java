     * However it is impossible to tell if the current "onConnect" call is the last vector for the currently connecting peer.
     * As soon as this method is called with a given vector then that vector may be used immediately on the given peer.
     * It will also be returned by the getVectors command for the given peer.
     * The connected vectors value will be -1 if this value is unknown or not supported by this shared memory.
